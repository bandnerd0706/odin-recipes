        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In this recipe, we combine our ingredients of cheese, pasta, and milk to create a classic dish: Macaroni and Cheese. We season this dish with some Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, and onion powder to provide a tangy twist on the classic dish.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1.75 pounds macaroni</li>
                <li>0.75 cup butter</li>
                <li>0.75 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>6 cups milk, divided</li>
                <li>1 TBS Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp mustard powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
                <li>8 oz shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
                <li>24 oz shredded American cheese</li>
                <li>8 oz potato chips</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>0.5 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F</li>
                <li>Bring large pot of water to boil. Cook macaroni in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly mix in flour, whisking constantly; cook until no longer smells like flour and is brown, about 5 min.</li>
                <li>Pour 1 cup milk into mixture, whisking thoroughly, about 45 sec. Repeat twice.</li>
                <li>Whisk remaining 3 cups milk. Stir in Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low, cook about 10 minutes until thick. Add half the shredded Cheddar, stirring until it melts completely. Repeat with remaining Cheddar and American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Remove from heat once cheese is fully incorporated.</li>
                <li>Stir macaroni into cheese sauce. Divide between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.</li>
                <li>Crush and mix potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top macaroni evenly with potato mixture. Spray with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Bake in oven until crust is golden brown and sauce is bubbling, about 35-45 min.</li><br/><br/>
